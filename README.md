- 👋 Hi, I’m @Lucasjamesweir

- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to apply my skills of coding and web design in cad to real life situations.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on game design definetely 
- 📫 How to reach me ... you can reach me on my github.
- more info on the idea - it started around 3 years ago when i wanted to try and create a game which could harness all the skills i had learnt to prior years and it is working pretty well for me.I think it would be really good for me to use all these skills as i said, in real life situations.
